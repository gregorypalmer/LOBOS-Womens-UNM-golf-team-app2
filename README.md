# LOBOS-Womens-UNM-golf-team-app2
app that uses a FULL STACK with a database to create a golf team performance management application for the LOBOS UNM Womenâ€™s golf team.   This app will enable myself and my team to have up to date access to each others statistics such as event results position, par rounds, and World ranking and see our current and previous performance progress and be able edit and update any results as they occur and add new team members or remove team members as they leave UNM.
The data will be stored in MONGO DB and include team members basic information, with their yearly golf performance statistics. 
I may also show golf upcoming and past events and their information such as date, location, results, but this would add complexity with two tables so I may not do this for the first version.

 I will use CRUD (create, retrieve, update and delete) software to implement my backend and front end to create and update players who are currently members or new members.

The front end will show the team members and their recorded statistics and World Ranking with additional links to UNM golf data and information. 
I will also show any upcoming events. 

The front end data will be nicely formatted using tables and have headings to indicate what the data represents.
I may include a header and footer section to show any other information.

The frontend will be written in HTML and JAVASCRIPT.

 AND it will communicate with a BACKEND JAVASCRIPT web service written to access my data from a MONGO DB table and NODE JS.

There will be a statistics row created for a new added player.
