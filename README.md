# LOBOS-Womens-UNM-golf-team-app2
app that uses a FULL STACK with a database to create a golf team performance management application for the LOBOS UNM Womenâ€™s golf team.   This app will enable myself and my team to have up to date access to each others statistics such as event results position, par rounds, and World ranking and see our current and previous performance progress and be able edit and update any results as they occur and add new team members or remove team members as they leave UNM.
